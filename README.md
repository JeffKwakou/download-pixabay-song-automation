# Automated Audio Download from Pixabay with Puppeteer and Node.js

The project is a Node.js script that uses the Puppeteer library to scrape and download audio files from the Pixabay website. The script uses a headless browser to navigate to the Pixabay website, scroll down the page to load more audio files, and extract the download links for each file. It then uses the download library to download each file to a specified directory.

The script is useful for anyone who wants to automate the process of downloading audio files from Pixabay. It can save a lot of time and effort compared to manually downloading each file one by one.
